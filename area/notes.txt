Subject monks or drows~
Text
I am writing a note because there are classes that have a steal shield
that you cant attack through but they can attack you through, and also
I dont know what class this is, monk or drow, but they have a blind
where you cant get rid of it unless you go clear it at the healer
so you cant cap them even if you mort them because you cant tie em up
Now i know that we get advantages, but for all advantages we get, we get heavy 
disadvantages , and all of the things that we get, we can only use in battle, 
so in conclusion i think that a spell or skill where they can 
attack but not be attacked or kill but not be tied up or capped is 
quite unfair, just make it so when i kill them i can see them, or
something.
maybe you wanted it to be this way.  Thank-you

First off this isnt avix, this is cannibus using avix's char.  Now im doing this because we got pyyrus in his own little safe room
attacking me with hand goody and avix with his spells, and i cant get to him becausw he has his god damn
guardian who slays, and he wont leave cuz he can cast spells from there
second off we got beef switching from char to char .
Me and goody got yoda and madbeef on us, yoda seems to be able to get into our clan scott free. with his invis even when i do kick his ASS he just darkens the room so i cant cap him.
i had him and madbeef and someone else, darken the room and attack me then yoda caped me, now thats a gang rape.  Finally the cheating ass fag fuck yoda is to pussy to ever attack straight up, he never goes vis, so there is no chance of us c
make us weaker, cuz then well show these pussy ass mother fuckers whats up.  maybe thell come out of hide and fight us.  I also think that you need a few safe rooms.  there is no place safe for me to hide and regen.
Sorry about all the swears, but i am majorly pissed.
and if you are going to get anyone in trouble for this let it be cannibus( the person that is wrtiting this).
thank you elkor and i trust that you will make this mud safe and fair so that we can all have fun again.

ok elkor now this is fucking bull shit, ( sorry for all this cussing im about to do).
I had 3 people yoda, beef and someone else gang up and cap me.
I got yoda who has that faggot ass blind and dark room and invis, i can never cap him
FUCKING never, even when i do mort him, because i cant see him, now tell me how that is fair.
i got beef who can seem to flee no matter what i do, but of course, i cant flee.
Then i also have beef going on as pyyrus and attacking me with spells
from his god damn own little safe room while yoda attacks me in my own fucking hq.
but of course i cant get pyyrus cuz he gets that real nice gaurd with the damn slay command.
So if all these other classes are getting this stuff because they say we are so strong (which they dont know the disadvantages we get)
then please make us weaker, so i can get back to having fun.
Thanky you elkor, i trust that you will make this mud fun a fair once again.
One more thing, we need atleast one safe room somewhere.  The drows have one.

We are taking a 0 tolerance for cheating, so 
let this be a warning.
There is to be NO EXP BOTTING
There is to be NO MULTIPLAYING (except for the spellbot senerio)
You are not to use the Executioner's Axe's (don't try and hide
them by renaming them etc cause that will really piss us off)
If you have one let a god know ASAP so we can collect them without
punishing you.
And there is alway the normal NO abusing bugs thing or crashing the mud.
Hopefully we will have a help policy in soon.
Until then, if in doubt or seems too good to be true, it is illegal!!! :P
